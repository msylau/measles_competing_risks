"raw_data" contains the original measles data in an R workspace file and compressed file of csv-files. Because of changes in reporting boundaries in the late 1960's the data has two spatial configurations. 

The pre-vaccination data (1944 through 1964) are data for all 954 urban centers (cities and towns). 

The pre-post data (1944 through 1994) are data for all 354 urban centers (cities and towns) for which the pre-vaccination data have been aggregated according to post-1960 boundaries.

BIRTHS:
- ewB4494 is the annual number of births recorded for each of the 354 pre-post urban centers

- ewBu4464 is the annual number of births recorded for each of the 954 pre- urban areas

MEASLES:
- ewM4494 are the weekly number of measles cases recorded for each of the 354 pre-post urban centers. 

- ewBu4464 are the weekly number of measles cases recorded for each of the 954 pre- urban areas

Note the length of the time series are not a multiple of 52 because every 4-5 years have 53 reporting periods

POPULATION:
- ewP4494 are the annual population size for each of the 354 pre-post urban centers

- ewBu4464 is annual population size for each of the 954 pre- urban areas

COORDINATES:
- ewXY4494 are lat-long for each of the 354 pre-post urban centers

- ewBu4464 are lat-long population size for each of the 954 pre- urban areas
